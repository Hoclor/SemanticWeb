# SemanticWeb
Code for RDF and SPARQL assignment for `Semantic Web` submodule as part of `Software, Systems and Applications IV` module, taken in my fourth year of Computer Science at Durham University

For this assignment I investigated several join algorithms available in SPARQL and evaluated their scalability in different conditions, producing a focused 3-page report on the results.
